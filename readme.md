## VSCode Setup

If you already have a Visual Studio installation set up for C++, follow this:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc

Otherwise, follow this guide to install an appropriate compiler:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp

Note that MinGW recently had a change that doesn't handle wildcards to specify source files, so cpp files need to be specifically added to the args list in `tasks.json`.
